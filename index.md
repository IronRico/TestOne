# Alaska Region Annotated Glossary of Data Management Terms 
___


Terms may have different meanings depending upon the context or discipline in which they are used. The Alaska Region Data Stewardship Team (DST) has compiled the following annotated glossary to assist in understanding terms used in relation to data management. 


The DST will attempt to use common word definitions as provided by the [Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary](http://www.merriam-webster.com/), however, terms used within technical disciplines, policies or legislation often have definitions that vary from those in common use. This glossary is intended to help users understand terms that are commonly used within the broader data management community and to identify the preferred use of a particular term within the context of Alaska Region Data Management.
